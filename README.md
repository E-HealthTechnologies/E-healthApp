# E_health

Ehealth is a mobile application designed to provide a convenient and efficient way to monitor patients remotely. The system consists of a hardware box containing several sensors that are capable of sensing vital data such as glucose levels, temperature, blood pressure, and heartbeat. This data is then transmitted to the mobile application via TCP and displayed in real-time.
