# E_health

Ehealth is a mobile application designed to provide a convenient and efficient way to monitor patients remotely. The system consists of a hardware box containing several sensors that are capable of sensing vital data such as glucose levels, temperature, blood pressure, and heartbeat. This data is then transmitted to the mobile application via TCP and displayed in real-time.

## Features

Firebase database for storing patient data.
Remote monitoring by doctors for improved patient care.

## Usage
To use the Home Hospitalization System, simply log in to the app using your credentials. If you are a patient, you can use the hardware box to measure your vital signs, and the data will be automatically sent to the app for review. If you are a doctor, you can access the patient's data through the app and remotely monitor their health status. The app provides a platform for the doctor to make informed decisions about the patient's treatment plan and adjust it as needed.
